			<p>Welcome to Plurality For Singlets! Let's get started with the obvious questions:</p>
			<h3>What's <strong>Plurality</strong>?</h3>
			<p><strong>Plurality</strong> is to have more than one individual sharing a body. These individuals are often referred to as <strong>headmates</strong>, <strong>system members</strong>, or <strong>alters</strong>. These individuals from a <strong>system</strong>. Members in the system may <strong>front</strong> individually or in groups. <strong>Fronting</strong> is the term for being "in control" of the body.</p>
			<p><u>NOTE</u>: There are a lot of negative connotations surrounding the term <strong>alters</strong>, so unless you have been given express permission to refer to system members as such, it's best avoided.</p>
			<h3>What's a <strong>Singlet</strong>?</h3>
			<p>A <strong>singlet</strong> is, quite simply put, someone who isn't plural. The term is by no stretch an insult, and is simply used to differentiate systems from non-systems, so please don't take it negatively!</p>
			<h2>Common Courtesy</h2>
			<p>One of the most common hurdles that systems face is a bombardment of "I just don't know how to talk to you." Below are some handy do's and don'ts:
			<h3>DO</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Use collective pronouns and system names:</strong> Many systems have collective pronouns and system names that can be used to refer to the system as a whole, especially if you aren't sure who is fronting. For example, our system, The Flock, uses it/its collectively, even though individual members have their own pronouns.</li>
				<li><strong>Make an effort to get to know members individually:</strong> System members are individuals, and will generally have different interests and preferences.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>DON'T</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ask when a certain member will be fronting:</strong> Generally speaking, we don't know! Some members can be brought to front voluntarily, but this often puts stress on the system and can cause headaches or confusion.</li>
				<li><strong>Ask why a bot is talking:</strong> Many plural systems use a bot called PluralKit to talk on Discord. Due to the nature of the program, their communications display the bot tag, but they themselves are not bots - and we get very, very tired of the jokes.</li>
			</ul>
